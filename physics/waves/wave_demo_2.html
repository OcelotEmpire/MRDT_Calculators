    <p>
        Let's look at two pictures of a wave. In one we'll plot y as a function of x, set the wave going 
        and then hit the pause button. This is like taking a photograph of the wave, so we freeze it at one instant 
        in time.

        What is the wavelength of our wave? It's the distance between two particles that are 2&pi; out of phase 
        with one another. For instance, it's the distance between one peak and the next.
    </p>

        In our other view we'll focus on the motion of a single particle, plotting y as a function of time.
        Again look at two particles that are 2&pi; out of phase with one another. Here the "distance" between 
        them has units of time - it's the period of the wave.
